# verso-Package-handler
Verso Package Handler is a simple extension for Unity to import/export objects between projects.

The Verso Package Handler consists in simplifying the process of import/export objects and optimizing the package's length.

WHY VERSO PACKAGE HANDLER WAS MADE?
Thinking on agilize and facilitate the data to be on Package content, this extension was made to recreate objects as exactly that was made, positioned and the same values.

HOW IT'S WORK?
The process was thought to be easy and simple. The Verso package will pick up the objects that have a "Verso Object". That object will not be in the Package content to export.
